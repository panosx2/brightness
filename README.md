# brightness

Brightness App for Linux OS, written in Vala

Instead of adjusting the backlight, this app uses `xrandr` to change the brightness of the image displayed on your screen. This can be useful for displays without an adjustable backlight, displays with a too-bright minimum backlight, or OLED displays.
